				<h1 class="display-4">Hi!</h1>
				<p>
					I’m Anne, a 3B student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past 2 years, I've worked at a variety of companies from a small startup in Waterloo, ON, 
					to working on a tiny team structured as a startup but funded by a large bank, to working for Uber ATG. 
					Similarly, I've also worked on a huge variety of projects including developing native iOS and Android 
					apps, frontend and backend web dev, metrics-based data analysis on complex machine learning models, 
					and even independently setting up a dev-ops pipeline. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although I don't have any professional experience in hardware, I have taken quite a few embedded systems 
					courses as part of my degree including an embedded microprocessor systems course and a 
					systems programming and concurrency course. I also worked on UW Rocketry's electrical team last year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Someday, I want to solo travel around Australia and New Zealand, spend a year just traveling the world, 
					and hike part of the Appalachian trail. I also have a huge interest in history, mainly art history, but I 
					also love studying ancient culture and philosophy outside of programming. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's my <a href="https://annewang27.github.io/3B_resume.pdf">resume</a> if you want to take a look!

					The term I spent working at IA was extremely eye opening and rewarding. Although I've had experience working at startup companies in the past, 
					working at IA was an entirely different experience with it immediately becoming clear that my contributions were vital to the 
					progress of the company as a whole. As one of two people working on the code base, I was the lead developer on the backend system 
					for a company that was in the midst of rapidly expanding their client base which meant that a lot of older code had to be rewritten 
					and sometimes completely redesigned to allow the company to keep up with their growing data needs. This meant I was given plenty of 
					opportunities to make an impact on the systems I was working on that I knew would continue to matter after my term was over including 
					things like redesigning database structures. I also had the pleasure of working very closely with healthcare professionals to develop 
					new core functionalities and graphs that would allow us to analyze and display our data in new impactful ways to users who have a bit 
					more trouble interpreting information. The work I did at IA was rewarding in a way that I haven't often experienced at other companies 
					where the work I was doing was immediately being used in production with real customers who were relying on IA for their health and these 
					customers were able to return with direct feedback with ways the products could be improved.

					In 2020, I had the privilege of working at Uber ATG to develop the technology that would allow autonomous 
					vehicles to safely share our streets. The team I was on developed complex machine learning models which were 
					able to detect and label important things, such as pedestrians and vehicles, using LiDAR data. While I didn't 
					get a chance to directly improve these models, I worked closely with other members of my team to research, propose, 
					and implement light weight metrics to monitor the performance of these models without relying on ground truth data, 
					which is extremely expensive to produce. Since the metrics I implemented didn't add any significant overhead, we 
					were able to collect these metrics in real time in Honeycomb and AWS. In addition, while analyzing the results 
					of these metrics, we discovered that one metric could also be used as a powerful debugging tool for model training. 
					Over the course of the summer, I presented bi-weekly deep dives about my project including a final deep dive and 
					project showcase presented to the entire company.

					Despite being funded by a large bank, working at Live Labs really felt more like working at a tiny startup with 
					a small team of 3 full-time employees and 3 other co-op students. Along with a UX designer and a product manager, 
					we created, from ideation to release, 3 pilot projects including native iOS and Android apps leveraging two different 
					types of machine learning models. The projects we worked on were incredibly diverse so I was required to very quickly 
					pickup tons of new languages and frameworks which allowed me to really grow as a software developer. Since we were 
					such a small team, we were expected to act as full-time employees and often ended up becoming the team expert on a 
					pilot. This gave me a really strong sense of ownership over the products that I built and the work I did; so much 
					so that I received a rating of 'Outstanding' on the final work term evaluation for my “incredible ability to learn 
					new software and take ownership of [my] work”.

					Thanks to the smaller company size and the flexibility of my team, I had the amazing opportunity to work on four different key products. I gained exposure to a wide variety of programming languages and 
					frameworks including everything from the huge variety of available javascript frameworks to OpenGL to Ant Design and React. In addition, although I initially started out doing the things I was hired for, 
					like manual testing iOS apps and developing basic unit tests, I was quickly able to move on to independently creating complex integration tests, adding new features on a variety of platforms, and even 
					implementing a huge new animation feature on our Android SDK.
