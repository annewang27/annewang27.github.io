				<h1 class="display-4">Hi!</h1>
				<p>
					I’m Anne, a 2B student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past 2 years, I've worked at a variety of companies from a small startup in Waterloo, ON, 
					to working on a tiny team structured as a startup but funded by a large bank, to working for Uber ATG. 
					Similarly, I've also worked on a huge variety of projects including developing native iOS and Android 
					apps, frontend and backend web dev, metrics-based data analysis on complex machine learning models, 
					and even independently setting up a dev-ops pipeline. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although I don't have any professional experience in hardware, I have taken quite a few embedded systems 
					courses as part of my degree and I'm currently taking an embedded microprocessor systems course and a 
					systems programming and concurrency course. I also worked on UW Rocketry's electrical team last year and 
					I'm part of UW Robotic's firmware team this semester to develop a Mars Rover.
				</p>
				<p>
					Someday, I want to solo travel around Australia and New Zealand, spend a year just traveling the world, 
					and hike part of the Appalachian trail. I also have a huge interest in history, mainly art history, but I 
					also love studying ancient culture and philosophy outside of programming. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's my <a href="https://annewang27.github.io/2B General.pdf">resume</a> if you want to take a look!

				Thanks to the smaller company size and the flexibility of my team, I had the amazing opportunity to work on four different key products. I gained exposure to a wide variety of programming languages and 
				frameworks including everything from the huge variety of available javascript frameworks to OpenGL to Ant Design and React. In addition, although I initially started out doing the things I was hired for, 
				like manual testing iOS apps and developing basic unit tests, I was quickly able to move on to independently creating complex integration tests, adding new features on a variety of platforms, and even 
				implementing a huge new animation feature on our Android SDK.

								the CAN bus library to ensure that critical messages aren’t lost when the transmit buffers run out of room. Other responsibilities include testing, debugging, and assembling
